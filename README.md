  ## Approach

The approach taken to complete this e-commerce website included the following steps:

1. **Product Listing**:
- Data for the products was fetched from the [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/) and displayed with product images, names, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
-Filtering options were implemented to allow users to sort products by category and price range.

2. **Shopping Cart**:
- A cart section was developed for users to view and manage selected items.
- Users can increase or decrease item quantities or remove items from the cart.
- Real-time updates of the cart total and item count were implemented for a dynamic shopping experience.

3. **Checkout Process**:
- A Checkout section was developed to calculate the total cost of items in the cart and allow users to provide shipping information and payment details.
- While this project doesn't include actual payment processing (for simplicity), it showcases the flow of entering payment information.

4. **Responsive Design**:
- The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations.
- The layout is optimized for desktop and mobile devices to ensure a consistent and user-friendly interface.
